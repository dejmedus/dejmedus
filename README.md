## Hi all!

🫐 I'm a Dev Degree intern at Shopify interested in all tech's possibilities for doing good.

🍊 I build things with TypeScript, React, Python, and CSS/Tailwind.

🥝 I've used Supabase, Postgres, AWS + more in recent projects.

🍓 I’m currently learning more about Ruby.
  
🌼 Ask me about my plants (and remind me to water them).
